# SpreadEagleCrossTheBlock
It's Death Grips!

This is my Death Grips video game. I've been working on it on and off. It's about Spreading Eagles around a city block by whipping them at people.

Notes I keep to remind me of what to do next:
power up animations (powers that b scale and glow/mc ride turning red for hot head)

start screen should be a button instead of all screen to start
recap/feedback screen. with high score record
	**pause for a second for people still hitting the screen before demo ends**
dispose as much stuff as possible -> more after adding other audio bytes
	**im creating a bunch of textures for the animated actors. do i create them before hand so i can dispose of them properly? is that proper?**

remove unused tiles 

powers that b album cover actor animation?
bottomless pit sound byte (hot head intro and power up song seamlessly?)

bugs:
stay on lookout for:
eagles not appearing on touch screen of surface
everything moving in a stutter
(happened when camera started at 0f during testing then moving to power up and continuing moving)
can't hide album cover behind boxes because hitting the box will hit the album... player can't see it happening

secret stage(s) available if gotten all albums in single run?
during bounce effect, possibly hide secret album in the wall where you wouldnt see it.
8 bit stage?
break mirrors stage?

when done, go through level slowly and test all animations that when they are hit they die correctly.
